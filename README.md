**What is kaggle?** 
Kaggle is one of the world's largest data science platforms. It allows you to find, collate and manage datasets, machine learning models and even enter competitions! You're reading this, most likely, on Kaggle right now. 

**Why kaggle?**
Because it lets us use Jupyter notebooks in the cloud, for free. You can easily create and run code in little Code Blocks. Any code block in this notebook, you can run as you follow along and it will all work. Else, fork your own version and edit whatever you want!

To get your data I recommend using the datasets i've created: 
* https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jawdinmorris/bird-images
* https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jawdinmorris/cat-images
* https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jawdinmorris/puppy-images

Else, you need to find and import any datasets you'd like of individual animals. Kaggle has countless other datasets you can use. Our model doesn't need a lot to work, I use about 250 per animal. But meaningful, accurate results can be achieved with less than 50. 

You can use Python and BeautifulSoup, Bing API or even Google Chrome Extensions to quickly gather many images yourself.
